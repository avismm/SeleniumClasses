What is Selenium
Selenium is a tool that helps us to automate webApplications

get() vs navigate().

Both can navigate to a particular url.
get()---> u cannot go back or forward in history
navigate() --> u can go back and forward and also refresh

get()---> waits for the whole page to load
navigate() --> doesn't wait for the whole page to load

close() --> closes the current tab
quit() --> closes the browser session


HTML locators on a web page
name
id
class
linktext
partiallinktext
tagname
xpath
css

precausions:

1. Please choose a locator that is unique
2. Try and avoid locators that contain numbers as these may not be static
if there are locators with duplicate values, selenium will find the first one and interact with it.

linktext:
1. The element must be an "a" tag, a tag is also called anchor tag and it usually contains links
2. The element must have some text
If one of the conditions above is not fulfilled, you cannot use the text.

partiallinktext
1. The element must be an "a" tag, a tag is also called anchor tag and it usually contains links
2. The element must have some text
If one of the conditions above is not fulfilled, you cannot use the text.

webElement commands:
1. clear() --> clears the text box
2. getText() --> gets the text of the element. If there is no text, it will return null
