Implicit wait will wait until the web element is found in the DOM. Code
if the element is not found, an exception will be thrown
if element is found, it will move to the next piece of code
if the web element is already found (already existed) but disabled, the implicit wait will not work.

Syntax:
 driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(20));

 Explicit wait: This is a conditional wait. It waits for a certain condition to be
 fulfilled as specified by the end user. e.g., you click on the enable button and wait until the element gets enabled,
 or you click on the display button and wait for the element to appear.

 In the above scenarios, the HTML code is already there in the DOM but the element is either disabled or hidden.
 Explicit is normally used when the code is already there.

 Syntax:
 wait.until.elementIsEnabled(webElement)
